# Day 5

And... Another one for Soluna ! It's starting to feel like a useable dialect after all.

## Functions

- check: loop through ingredients ids and check if the value is inside the different range.
- solve: open the input, split the first part of the file into a list of (a b), then print the length of the return value of filter (that uses check) 


## How it felt ?

It was honestly pretty easy, just some struggle with creating list ((a b) (a b)) and some performances issues.

Yep performances issues... For some reason the code took around 4 secondes to solve the challenge. After a refactor (that should only be cosmectic), it solves the challenge in around 200ms ????

I might have some ideas on why, but I'm not really sure.

Otherwise, I'm SOOOOO happy to be able to use solve a second AoC day with Soluna.
