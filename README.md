# Advent of Code 2025

This year I tried to do stuff mostly in functionnal languages. I mainly know OCaml and Gleam but I still suck finding good solutions in these languages.

Every codes are kind of commented, and I'll try to do a proper readme for every days so that I explain how I looked at the problem and how I solved it

My solutions aren't made to be optimal, they are made to be easy to read/understand (atleast by me).
